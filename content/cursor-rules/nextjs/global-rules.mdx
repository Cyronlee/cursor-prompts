# Global Rules

The global rules for Next.js, TypeScript, shadcn/ui

```md
# Project Rules

## Framework & Technologies

- Framework: Next.js
- Language: TypeScript
- Package Manager: pnpm
- UI Library: shadcn/ui

## Code Structure

- Use the App Router pattern
- Keep pages minimal, focusing on layout and data fetching
- Place reusable components in `@/components/`
- Group related components in subdirectories
- Place utility functions in `@/lib/`
- Store types and interfaces in `@/types/`
- Place API routes in `@/app/api/`
- Place API clients in `@/api-clients/`
- Place custom hooks in `@/hooks/`

## Naming Conventions

- Files/Directories: Use kebab-case for file and directory names
- Components: Use PascalCase for component names
- Functions: Use camelCase for function names
- Constants: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants

## TypeScript Usage

- Always define explicit return types for functions
- Use interfaces for object shapes instead of type aliases where possible
- Avoid using `any` type - use proper typing or `unknown` if necessary

## State Management

- Use React hooks `useState` for simple component state
- Consider using context for shared state across components
- Keep state as close as possible to where it's used
- Prefer client components

## UI Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling components
- Follow shadcn/ui patterns for consistent UI
- Implement responsive design for all components

## Quality Standards

- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
